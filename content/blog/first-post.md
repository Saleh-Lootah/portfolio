### Hello World

Welcome to my new website, at the moment of it’s publishing it includes a home page, a sparse projects page, a blog page with one post, an empty gallery and a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). One would think that I’d gather some content before publishing it but I have been [bullied](https://saleh.boo/) to make it and publish it asap. Thank you [Humaid].

This website is built using the static website generator [Hugo], heavily inspired by the incredibly lightweight [huma.id] website. While mine does not come anywhere close to how lightweight and optimized [huma.id] is, it's still under 500kb.

### The Future

I hope to further refine and improve this page over time. One of the main reasons I have taken the time to build it is to encourage myself to start building publicly and deep dive into various topics of interest.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you’ve enjoyed browsing through my website.
