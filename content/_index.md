I like to build stuff. In the past I have delved into photography, photo editing, tried my hand at metal fabrication and a tiny bit of wood working. As of late, my main focus has been the web.

If you're interested in working with me, feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saleh-lootah/), [email](mailto:saleh.lootah3@gmail.com). You can also view my Github page at [Github](https://github.com/saleh-lootah).
