##### About me

I like to build.
In the past I have delved into photography, tried my hand at metal fabrication and a tiny bit of wood working. As of late, my main focus has been the web. I graduated from the University of Exeter with a BSc in Computer Science in 2021 and started working at Digital Dubai as a UI/UX Designer.
