## About me

I like to build and code. In the past I have delved into photography, tried my hand at metal fabrication and a tiny bit of wood working. As of late, my main focus has been the web.

I obsesses over the intricacies of visual design, interaction design and code, and while I embrace the fact that these factors hold significant weight in dictating the overall quality of the final design, I know that successful designs encompass much more than that. Successful designs are the result of well managed cross-discipline collaboration, where the less tangible aspects of the design process really come to light. I have come to appreciate the importance of diagramming and writing as crucial building blocks of the design process.
