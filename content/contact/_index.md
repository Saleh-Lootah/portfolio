I graduated from the University of Exeter with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I have since moved back to my home country and have been working as a UI/UX designer building the foundations of what is to be a city-wide digital design system

Stemming from an innate passion for design, I obsess over the intricacies of visual design, interaction design and the code that makes it all come to life. I strive to develop high quality products that solve problems.
